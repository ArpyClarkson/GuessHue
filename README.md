This project is a mobile app for Android and aims to create a simple "match 3" type game. The goal of this project is to create a reusable game framework for Android devices that will ease the development of future projects. This project is geared towards personal use and may not be adequately documented- additionally, compatibility support and support for issues may not be available after the development cycle of this project has ended. This project is not intended for public release and is provided only as a resource for personal use.
